### The Practice

This repository houses the source code for [studiojemd.com](https://studiojemd.com), the official website of Studio JEMD.
We craft bespoke web interfaces that prioritize sensory interaction, typographic precision, and performance.

The architecture follows a strict "Swiss Style" philosophy: removing the non-essential to let the content—and the motion—breathe.

### Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Motion Engine:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
- **Styling:** CSS3 Custom Properties
- **Performance:** 90+ Lighthouse Score target
